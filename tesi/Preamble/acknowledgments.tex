I am overwhelmed in all humbleness and gratefulness to acknowledge my depth to my advisor Prof. Massimo Manghisoni for the continuous support of my thesis work, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for master thesis work.\\
I would also like to thank Elisa and Paolo for their encouragement, insightful comments and support during my entire stay in the electronics laboratory. \\
Finally, I wish to thank my parents Luisa and Bortolo for their unconditional trust, timely encouragement, and endless patience.
